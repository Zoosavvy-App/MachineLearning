# Zoo Savvy-MachineLearning
# About the model :
  •	Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Image Recognition:
    ZooSavvy employs a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image recognition purposes. CNNs are highly effective in extracting hierarchical features from images, making them well-suited for tasks like object recognition. In the context of ZooSavvy, the        CNN model is trained to recognize distinctive features in animal images, allowing users to capture photos of animals in zoos. The use of CNN enhances the accuracy and efficiency of animal identification, contributing to a more robust and reliable user        experience.
    
  •	Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) for Chatbot Interaction:
    The chatbot functionality in ZooSavvy is powered by a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network. LSTMs are a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) known for their ability to understand and generate sequences of data. In ZooSavvy, LSTM is utilized to create      an interactive chatbot that can engage users in meaningful conversations about animal conservation. The model's architecture enables it to understand context, remember previous interactions, and provide informative responses, contributing to a dynamic        and engaging user experience.
    
By combining CNN for image recognition and LSTM for chatbot interaction, ZooSavvy leverages the strengths of each model to deliver a comprehensive and interactive educational platform for zoo visitors.
